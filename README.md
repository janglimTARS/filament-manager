# Filament Manager

A mobile-first filament inventory manager built as a single-page vanilla JS app served by a Cloudflare Worker.

## Features
- Inventory CRUD for filament spools
- Low-stock alerts (<20% remaining)
- Search + filter (material, brand, free-text)
- Usage calculator (remaining filament length estimate)
- localStorage persistence with JSON export/import
- Bambu P1S printer configuration stub (IP + token saved locally)
- Dark, responsive Tailwind-based UI
- Stats dashboard (spools, remaining weight, value, material breakdown)

## Project Structure
- `public/index.html` - app shell and UI sections
- `public/app.js` - all app behavior and localStorage logic
- `public/styles.css` - custom dark theme and components
- `build.js` - inlines public assets into `src/index.js`
- `src/index.js` - generated Cloudflare Worker entry
- `wrangler.toml` - Worker config for `printing.janglim.cloud`

## Scripts
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
npm run deploy
```

> Note: `src/index.js` is generated by `npm run build`.
